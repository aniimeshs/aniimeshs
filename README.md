# Hey Folks! 
👋 Hey there, I’m Animesh
I'm a backend developer who loves building secure, scalable, and maintainable applications. I enjoy solving real-world problems through clean architecture, efficient code, and thoughtful design.

🔧 What I Work With

I mostly work with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JavaScript, but I’m also comfortable diving into React, C++, and exploring DevOps tools.
Authentication? ✅ Done it with JWT & RBAC
REST APIs? ✅ Designed and built them
CLI tools? ✅ Built a few for fun and productivity

🚀 What I’ve Built

One of my favorite projects is DevVault – a Developer Notes + Project Tracker. Think of it as your personal dev journal where notes are linked to projects, complete with tags, filters, and CRUD operations.
Besides that, I’ve created weather apps, task trackers, and even an expense tracker in C++.

📚 What I’m Learning

Right now, I’m deep into the CS50x 2025 course – really sharpening those computer science fundamentals. I’m also diving into Low-Level Design, System Design, and exploring how to take backend systems to production-level scale.

📖 Books I Recommend
These are gems that have shaped how I think and code:

Grokking Algorithms – Aditya Y. Bhargava

System Design Interview Vol 1 & 2 – Alex Yu

Clean Code – Robert C. Martin

Python Crash Course – Eric Matthes
